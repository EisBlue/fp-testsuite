# fp-testsuite
Repository with testcases for all homework assignments for 
Functional Programming, fall semester 2020 
([TU Wien](https://www.tuwien.at/en/))

## How to use
There is a [PDF](https://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/knoop/lehre/ws20/fp185A03/Fprog.pdf)
on the [courses webiste](https://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/knoop/fp185A03_ws2021.html)
where Page 3 provides instruction on how to test with cabal.
Just follow those steps and later replace the files `TestSuiteXY.hs` 
with the same files from this repository.

## Be decent!
This repository is managed by your fellow students, so don't expect full
testsuite on the day we get the assignments. However, feel free to contribute 
your own testcases with a Pull request.
